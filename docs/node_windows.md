## Quickstart for those using Windows

- Clone the repository
- Open the `scripts` folder
- If you don't already have Node, run `download_node.bat` first, then `install_node.bat` to install Node
- Run `install_dependencies.bat` file to install the dependencies
- Use `dev.bat` to start developing
- Access the client at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

### !!! IMPORTANT !!!

- Shut down the client and server properly by `Ctrl-C` instead of clicking the close button. You won't be able to start again due to the port being already in use.
- In case that happened, open the Task Manager and kill all Node processes.
